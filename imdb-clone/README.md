Fetching Data from the API and rendering.

## `react-router-dom`
It is a library for managing routes in React applications, allowing you to create and navigate between different pages or views in a single-page app (SPA) without reloading the page.

Context provides a way to share data globally across components without having to pass props manually through every level of the component tree. 

## React.createContext() -> create new context
## Context.Provider -> provide context through value={}
## useContext() -> access context values

## `npm install -D tailwindcss`
## `npx tailwindcss init`
